Long ago, people lived happily under the rule of a king. 

The people of the kingdom were very happy as thay led a properous life with an abundance wealth and no misfortunes. Once, the king decided to go visiting places of historical importance and pilgrim centres at distant places. He decied to travel by foot to interact with his people. People of distant places were happy to have a conversation with their king. They were proud that their king had a kind heart. After several week of travel, he was quite happy that he visited many pligrim centres and witnessed his people leading a properous life. 

However he had one regret. He had a intorable pain in his feed as it was his first trip by foot covering long distance. He complained his minister that the roads were not comfortable and were very stony. He could not tolerate the pain. He said that he was very much worried about the people who had to walk along those roads as it would be painfull for them too. Consider all this, he ordered to cover the roads in the whole country with leather so that the people of his kingdom can walk comfortably. The king's ministers was stunned to hear his order as it would mean that thousands of cow would have to be slaughtered in order to get sufficent quallity of leather and it would cost a huge amount of money. 

Finally, a wise man come from the ministry to the king and said that he had another idea. The king asked what the alternative was. The minster said "Instead of covering the roads with leather, why dont you just have a piece of leather cut in appropriate shape to cover your feet?". The king were very much surprised and applaued the wisdom of the minister. He orderd a pair of leather shose for himself and requested all hist countrymen also to wear shoes. 

Moral: Instead of trying to change the world, we should try to change ourselves.
